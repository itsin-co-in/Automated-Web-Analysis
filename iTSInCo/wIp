Input to gemini:

1. Q:
   For certain github hosted project, I need to have "Java 17". Compare "Java 17" with following versions that are present on my gitpod:

    "openjdk version "11.0.24" 2024-07-16 LTS

    OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu11.74+15-CA (build 11.0.24+8-LTS)

    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu11.74+15-CA (build 11.0.24+8-LTS, mixed mode)"

A:  Java 17 is more capable then this OpenJDK.

2. How to install JRE 17 as a primary runtime for my project that is running on gitpod?

A:

 Website Architecture Analysis Workbook

 created .env file

  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
  FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key

 For automating website architecture analysis, Python would be the most suitable language due to its extensive libraries and tools for web automation and analysis. Let me create a practical implementation guide.

 This Python implementation offers several advantages:

 1. **Rich Ecosystem**:
    - BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
    - Selenium for dynamic content analysis
    - Playwright for performance testing
    - Requests for HTTP analysis
    - cssutils for CSS analysis

 2. **Key Features**:
    - Automated DOM structure analysis
    - CSS and design system analysis
    - API endpoint detection
    - Performance metrics collection
    - Security header analysis
    - Accessibility checking
    - Multiple report formats (JSON, HTML, Excel)

 3. **Required Dependencies**:

 ```bash
 
 sudo pip3 install selenium lighthouse-python playwright
 
 sudo apt install python3-bs4 python3-requests python3-cssutils python3-pandas 
 ```

 Would you like me to:

 1. Add any specific analysis features?
 2. Explain how to implement particular sections in more detail?
 3. Create additional modules for specific aspects of the analysis?
